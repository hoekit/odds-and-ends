#### Relation between a function and its inverse

Given a function `f(x)`, its inverse is `f⁻¹(x)` such that `f⁻¹(f(x)) = x`.

The mental picture is that, giving x to a function f, returns f(x). And
giving f(x) to its inverse returns x.

      x  -->  f   -->  f(x)
    f(x) -->  f⁻¹ -->    x

**Explanation:**

Imagine a vending machine is like a _function_ where you insert a coin
and you get, say, a chocolate bar. Now, imagine a different kind of
machine, let's call it the _unvending_ machine, which, when given a
chocolate bar, spews out a coin. That unvending machine is like an
_inverse function_.

So you could start with a coin, walk up to the vending machine, insert a
coin, and get a chocolate bar in return. Then, walk up to the unvending
machine, insert the chocolate bar and get back a coin in return.

Below is the mental picture:

    coin      -->  vending machine    -->  choco-bar
    choco-bar -->  unvending machine  -->  coin
