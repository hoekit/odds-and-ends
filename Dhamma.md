#### Quotes

A very insightful quote from `Unbroken` by `Laura Hillenbrand`:

    The  paradox of vengefulness is that it makes men dependent upon
    those who have harmed them, believing that their release from pain
    will come only when they make their tormentors suffer. In seeking
    the Bird's death to free himself, Louie had chained himself, once
    again, to his tyrant. During the war, the Bird had been unwilling to
    let go of Louie; after the war, Louie was unable to let go of the
    Bird.
