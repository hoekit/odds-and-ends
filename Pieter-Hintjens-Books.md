        This book is an all-in-one primer for anyone aiming to build
        on-line communities. It covers the theory of Social
        Architecture, and the tools you need to build a community. It
        explains the ZeroMQ community in detail, including its
        collaboration process (C4). This is a powerful book for anyone
        building an Open Source community, or an on-line community in
        other areas.

        Thirty-five years I've written code, a necromancer weaving
        spells to bring the dead to life. Hardware and electronics never
        held any charm for me. I've no love for chips and cables and
        solder. Give me a keyboard, a screen, and a language, and you
        have my attention.  Thirty-five years produced a lot of work. So
        I thought, maybe time to talk about some of those projects.

        Don't look for serial killers… one in 25 of the people around
        you is a psychopath, hiding and living a secret life.
        Psychopaths take what they want, using their charm and wits.
        They feel only the emotions of a predator. In this book Pieter
        Hintjens decodes the mystery of the psychopath. Why do such
        people exist? How do they operate? And most critical of all, can
        we learn to avoid them, or escape them? The answers will
        enlighten you. This book delivers practical tools and techniques
        to survive the most difficult people.

        The whole planet is getting connected and building vast new
        communities. Billions of us are online, all the time. This
        online world thinks faster, and thinks differently. Smart, fast,
        and creative, our new communities are a very real challenge to
        old power and old money. And old money — after its War on Drugs
        and War on Terror — is now launching its War on the Internet.
        What is going on, and where will this lead us? Pieter Hintjens —
        author, programmer, and activist — tells all in this vast story
        of Culture & Empire: Digital Revolution.
